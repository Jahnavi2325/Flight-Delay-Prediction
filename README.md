# Flight-Delay-Prediction
Flight delays can disrupt travel plans and impact the aviation industry's efficiency. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict flight delays based on historical flight data and relevant features. By accurately anticipating delays, travelers and stakeholders can make informed decisions and take appropriate actions. This repository contains the code and resources for the Flight Delay Prediction project.

I have collected the dataset from kaggle.
